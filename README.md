# Decentralized Voting System on Ethereum

This project implements a **Decentralized Voting System** on the Ethereum blockchain using **Solidity** for smart contracts and **Hardhat** for development. The system allows users to cast votes for candidates, ensuring transparency, security, and immutability, all built on the principles of blockchain technology.

## Features
- **Smart Contract**: Written in Solidity to handle the voting process and track votes.
- **Decentralized**: No central authority is required, and votes are immutable once cast.
- **Secure**: Only one vote per user is allowed, ensuring fair elections.
- **Event Logging**: Votes are logged on the blockchain for transparency.

## Components
1. **Voting Smart Contract**: Allows users to vote for their favorite candidates and track vote counts.
2. **Deployment with Hardhat**: Easy-to-use Hardhat deployment scripts for local and public blockchain networks.
3. **Frontend (Optional)**: A simple web interface that allows users to interact with the voting contract directly.

## Technologies
- **Solidity**: Smart contract programming language for Ethereum.
- **Hardhat**: Development environment to deploy and test smart contracts.
- **Ethereum**: The blockchain platform where the voting contract is deployed.
- **Ethers.js**: JavaScript library to interact with Ethereum.

## Installation
